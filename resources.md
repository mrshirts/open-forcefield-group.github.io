The Open Forcefield Group makes a number of resources available to the community, including open source software, high-quality curated open datasets, and forcefields.

---

## Software

- [openforcefield](https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/openforcefield): A python toolkit from the Open Forcefield group for the development and use of modern molecular mechanics forcefields based on direct chemical perception and parameterized with rigorous statistical methods.
- [open-forcefield-tools](https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/open-forcefield-tools): Development space for property calculation and forcefield parameterization tools.
- [SMARTY](https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/smarty): A simple implementation of how Bayesian atom type sampling using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) over SMARTS types might work.

## Datasets

- [open-forcefield-data](https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/open-forcefield-data): Curated datasets from the NIST ThermoML database to be used for forcefield parameterization.
- [MiniDrugBank](https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/MiniDrugBank): A repository to track the creation and evolution of the MiniDrugBank Molecule set, filtered from [DrugBank Release Version 5.0.1](https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/5-0-1).

## Forcefields

- [smirnoff99Frosst](https://github.com/open-forcefield-group/smirnoff99Frosst): The first general-purpose implementation of a SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) as implemented by SMARTY and its ForceField class (in smarty.forcefield) for parameterizing small molecules for OpenMM.
